In developing countries, tax enforcement may vary in the opposite direction to the variation in tax base. This implies that in resource-abundant regions, effective tax rates of non-resource firms are also affected by economic fluctuations in resource sectors.\r\n\r\nChina divides firms into mining and non-mining sectors. Project leader Dr Fydor Tyutchev is exploring how a bigger fluctuation in China’s mining sector profitability translates into a greater volatility of effective tax rates on the non-mining firms. Further evidence uncovered by this project to date suggests the high volatility of taxation harms the non-mining sectors, leading to fewer organisations overall, with the smaller ones finding it hard to survive.",

            "desc": "Research on the interactions between plants and pathogens has become one of the most rapidly moving fields in the plant sciences, findings of which have contributed to the development of new strategies and technologies for crop protection.\r\n\r\nA good example of plant and pathogen evolution is the gene-for-gene interaction between the fungal pathogen Leptosphaeria maculans, causal agent of Blackleg disease, and Brassica crops (canola, mustard, cabbage, cauliflower, broccoli, Brussels sprouts). The newly available genome sequences for Brassica spp. and L. maculans provide the resources to study the co-evolution of this plant and pathogen. Plant disease resistance genes play a critical role in providing resistance against pathogens. The largest families of resistance genes are the nucleotide binding site and leucine rich repeat genes (NBS-LRRs) and receptor like proteins (RLPs). Hundreds of these genes are present within the genome, however the evolutionary history of these genes is not fully understood.\r\n\r\nGenome wide identification of these genes within and between species allows a study of which genes are core to a species or family and which have variable roles. Using state of the art genomics, this project aims to identify all these genes within Brassica species and wild relative species, perform comparative analysis within and between the species and provide an understanding of the evolution of these genes.\r\n\r\nAdditional projects are available to review and assess the correlation between known genomic regions containing resistance to a specific disease and NBS-LRR resistance genes in Brassica napus.

It is well known that human dentin represents the main bulk of tooth structure and it is in direct anatomical and functional connection with dental pulp forming what is known as “dentin-pulp complex”.\r\n\r\nHuman dentin is an avascular mineralized tissue that contains micro-sized dentinal tubules (DT) which form 3D capillaries system. Dentinal tubules run continuously from the dentino-enamel junction (DEJ) to the pulp chamber in coronal dentin, and from the cementum-dentin junction (CEJ) to the pulp canal(s) in the root dentin. Dentin was described as a porous biologic composite made up of apatite crystal filler particles in a collagen-matrix. The average diameters of dentinal tubules range from 1-2 µm depending on proximity to the pulp, age, maturation, and carious activity or other stimuli.\r\n\r\nDentinal tubules main branches are connected through many lateral smaller branches creating complex 3D capillaries system. This capillaries system is filled with water-based tissue fluid called dentinal fluid which flow from the pulp direction upward under the effect of the pulpal hydrostatic pressure. The fluid contents of the dentin tubules capillaries systems are connected to the fluid contents of the nano-sized collagen inter-fibrils spaces of the intertubular dentin, which might provide an alternative route for drug delivery to the avascular demineralized intertubular dentin collagen-matrix. In this research project, we are aiming to take this new drug-delivery platform further to explore its potential to be translated to clinical dentistry.",

            "desc": "Malignant mesothelioma is an almost uniformly fatal malignancy aetiologically linked to asbestos fiber inhalation, mainly through occupational exposure. Whilst mesothelioma can develop in the peritoneum, tunica vaginalis, and pericardium, the pleura is the primary site in around 90% of cases. Most systemic therapy research has been conducted in malignant pleural mesothelioma (MPM), which will be the focus of this review. Whilst some patients presenting with early disease will undergo aggressive surgery and multimodality therapy, most patients present with advanced disease and palliative systemic therapy will be their mainstay of treatment.\r\n\r\nSystemic therapy for mesothelioma has not yet benefited from the paradigm shift of personalized medicine. The first demonstration of benefit from systemic therapy of mesothelioma was in 2003, with the EMPHACIS study showing a modest improvement in overall survival (OS) for patients receiving cisplatin/pemetrexed, over cisplatin alone. The combination of cisplatin with the antifolate raltitrexed showed similar survival benefits but reported later, and is not widely used. The first challenge to this standard of care came in 2016, when the MAPS trial reported a further survival benefit for the addition of bevacizumab to cisplatin/pemetrexed. As supported by the NCCN and ASCO guidelines, this has changed the standard of care in some, but not all, parts of the world, due to the lack of FDA registration and universal reimbursement. Here, we discuss the history and role of anti-angiogenic strategies in mesothelioma, with an emphasis on clinical trial data and their clinical application.",

            "title": "A radiometric renaissance: making better use of an under-utilised geophysical-geochemical dataset",
            "desc": "There is evidence that with better understanding of the variations in radioelement (K, Th,U) content in mineralised environments and a better capability to model these responses, radiometric data could play a much greater role in exploration. Opportunities exist to work with geochemical and radiometric datasets from a wide range of deposit types to understand their radiometric signatures. The proposed research will comprise two basic approaches both of which will be tested using a new modelling method: \r\n\r\n(i) A radioelement (K, Th, U) based classification of rocks will be created. Radioelement concentrations are known to be correlated with concentrations of some major elements (Dickson and Scott, 1997), but no systematic study has been described. Establishing the relationships between ‘radiometric-based’ geology and geochemical rock classifications is key to better utilisation of radiometrics in a mapping role during exploration.\r\n\r\n(ii) There are periodic reports of detectable radiometric responses from hydrothermal alteration from various individual deposits of various types, e.g. VMS, orogenic gold and epithermal precious metals (Shrive et al., 1997). However, responses are inconsistent and often examples do not unequivocally demonstrate that alteration zones are the dominant causes of responses.\r\n\r\nWe propose to use a compilation of published descriptions of geochemical variations within alteration zones establish systematic relationships to better understand enhancement/depletion of the radioelements in alteration zones.\r\n\r\nKey to understanding radiometric responses from both alteration and different rock types is modelling of expected responses. Radiometric data are the only kind of geophysical data that are not routinely ‘modelled’. A unique radiometric forward modelling software package has been created by Dr Brian Minty and is available for this project. This software can be used to model radiometric responses of mineral system components, systematically exploring the effects of varying radioelement contents (for example in alteration zones), accounting for variable exposure, size and shape of the components and also topography.\r\n\r\nThe integration of these different lines of research has the potential to improve greatly our ability to extract geological information from radiometric datasets for exploration purposes.",
